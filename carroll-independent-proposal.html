	<p>Independent Project Proposal

My concept for the Independent Project is called Dukes N’spired.  This is a James Madison University platform for independent artists and creatives.  There are many students at JMU who use social media to promote their creative endeavors or small businesses.  Dukes N’spired would be a fully inclusive app for all creatives.  It would be a great platform to support small and local businesses.  The goal of this app would be to provide a safe, secure space for creatives to sell products.  Others could also buy their products.  It would eliminate the use of other social media platforms such as Instagram, where the main form of communication is direct messages, and most payments cannot be processed unless using an outside source such as Venmo.  The audience for my project is young adults, ages 18-25, creatives at James Madison University.  The audience would also be those in the JMU community looking to purchase from and support small, local businesses.  From a personal outlook, I know multiple people who have created small business for creative ideas via social media and both the sellers and buyers can had complaints via using this method.  My inspiration comes from applications such as Pinterest and Etsy.  Although these platforms can be great, they are not always the safest route to buying from independent creatives.  By next week, I will be prepared to share my research and in-depth ideas about the project.  By week 4, I will have bulk of the research completes and be ready to create the technical details and storyboards.  By week 5, I will have created a finished deliverable of the entire project and a prototype mockup for critique.
